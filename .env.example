# Optional: URL of the game server for remote play (Socket.io).
# When set, the app syncs state with the server so GM and teams on different devices share one session.
# Leave unset for local-only play (state only shared between tabs on the same machine).
# Example for local dev: http://localhost:3001
# Example for production: https://your-game-server.example.com
